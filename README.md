4. The config name corresponds to the cm/360 value. For example, config 40.cfg corresponds to 40cm/360 degrees, allowing you to easily launch it with the command: /exec 40



You might ask - why should I understand cm/360?
Answer - It allows you to compare and easily transfer the feeling of sensitivity to a different DPI and even between games. For example, in Quake Live, sensitivity is measured in different numbers. By understanding the precise sensitivity in cm/360, you can easily transfer it to another game.



Overall, the simplicity of creation and the ease of use of such configs with two mouse sensitivities will provide new sensations and space for imagination.
